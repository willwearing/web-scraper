They are real zealots, and it's lucky because organic farming is a way of life!Read more about our farmersThree important quality factorsGrass pasture gives a richer tasteOur cows and lambs are raised on grass and herbs, just as they are meant to be. In the winter, they get grass in the form of silage. Grass grazing results in a meat that is incredibly juicy, tasty and full of nutrition.Less stress, happier animalsMeat from Gårdssällskapet not only has a rich and full-bodied taste, but there is also other added value. The animals have been allowed to live a dignified and stress-free life where they have been able to graze juicy green grass and get soil on their faces. Good meat with a good conscience simply!Let the animals grow slowlyThe fact that the animals are allowed to eat grass and herbs means that they grow at a slower rate. The meat therefore has plenty of time to become naturally tender and tasty. The grazing animals also keep our landscapes open and contribute to the biological diversity of plants, birds, insects and other small insects.more about our animalsFeel free to sign up for our newsletter!
