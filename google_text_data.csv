This morning I accidentally ordered the $45 express delivery service, and didn’t notice. Instead of just taking the sale, Kuo Wei Wen personally emailed me to confirm that’s what I meant to select. So thankful, and blown away by the customer service they’ve offered since we started with them.”4.   Capital City CourierSERVICESSame-Day Courier, Letters / Envelopes, Legal Documents, Bank Deposits, Small Parcels, Medium Parcels, Large Parcels, Skids, Dock-To-Dock, Flat Deck, Power Tailgate, Trailer, Dedicated Trucks, Whiteglove Delivery, Emergency Delivery, Last-Minute Delivery, Out-Of-Town Delivery, Warehouse Services, Inventory ControlWEBSITEhttps://capitalcitycourier.ca/ADDRESS16644 117 Ave, Edmonton AB T5M 3W2CONTACT DETAILSPhone: 780-544-0445 Email: [email protected]OPERATING HOURSOpen 24 hours a day, 7 days a weekCapital City Courier is attempting to change the landscape of delivery processing and tracking by transitioning to a completely paperless and contactless system. Their logistics and operations revolve around electronic waybills and digital signatures.However, despite their transition to a paperless system, they still currently use traditional paper waybills for some transactions. This is because some clients’ organizational systems are still built upon what they call the “old-school service”, requiring them to retain these methods.Regardless, their same-day service can handle a range of small items such as documents, envelopes, bank deposits, and various parcels. Capital City Courier can also accommodate clients with larger items needed for transport, with a fleet that consists of a wide range of makes and models of vehicles.Some of their transport options include expedited deliveries executed with cars, minivans, pick-up trucks, cube vans, and flat deck trailers, just to name a few. They can deliver large items from one shipping dock to another and can accommodate emergency and last-minute deliveries as well.If you choose to go with Capital City Courier, you can also avail of their short and long-term storage in a 17,500 square foot warehouse. This storage facility is heated, monitored, controlled, and kept secure around the clock with six separate docking platforms that can accommodate trailers as large as 53-feet in length.ProsComplimentary white glove service for fragile itemsCan handle emergency and last-minute deliveriesWarehouse storage optionsConsNo bike or messenger servicesNeed to register an online account for payments and servicesCustomer ReviewsCapital City Courier’s fast and efficient services have helped them establish a regular customer base. One such client is Becky Mielke, who says:“I use Capital City Courier every week.  Jesse is prompt at replying and always acts quick to the changes I may need.  Very professional and helpful.  I strongly urge everyone to try this outstanding company out!  You will not regret it!”This company’s customer service has also helped them establish themselves as one of the forefront courier services in Edmonton. Matthew Tomczuk shares:“I contacted Capital City Courier through email and asked them to pickup an item in Edmonton and pack it for shipping to my address in Ontario. I dealt directly with Jesse and I can honestly say the entire process was quick and easy with no surprises. Best of all – during business hours, Jesse would answer my emails usually within minutes of hitting the “send button” at my end. Their level of responsiveness and their professional attitude, tends to be hard to find these days. Jesse always kept me in the loop to let me know the status of the shipment. It was a pleasure to deal with Capital City Courier.

Their original slogan of “smog-free delivery” still echoes in the company’s business practices today as they prioritize green initiatives in their business model.With Edmonton’s largest bike courier service, ACS Express offers both on-demand services and scheduled deliveries. They can handle one-way deliveries, round-trips, and guarantees it can deliver up to 100 of your parcels in one day!ACS Express has extensive experience in dealing with the government, law firms, and private corporations that have sensitive documents in need of special handling and delivery. Their couriers can process bank deposits, check certifications, and filing of legal/court documents.You can have peace of mind with their couriers since all drivers are cleared with both the Royal Canadian Mountain Police and the Edmonton Police Department! Some of their employees are even cleared with the Government of Canada security as well.We like that ACS Express pays attention to detail and reliability, and one way they achieve this is by using three different internet service providers to ensure no loss of connections. They even have several generators and backup power plans for all their networked computers.This intricate system provides you—the customer—with real-time tracking of your deliveries, and setting up an account with ACS gives you access to this web portal. Other advantages of registering an account include an online courier request, address book, exclusive rates, and the ability to see digital signatures as they’re received. What we like best about ACS Express is their green initiative, primarily using bike couriers and the small hybrid vehicles in their fleet whenever possible. We’re also a big fan that they prioritize paperless documentation and electronic or digital invoicing.ProsReal-time, lag-proof tracking of deliveriesGreen deliveries accomplished with bikes and hybrid vehiclesSecurity screened couriersConsNot open 24 hours a dayExpensive rates for point to point deliveriesCustomer ReviewsACS Express prides itself with its efficient and trusted couriers. Erin Downie relies on ACS Express for their court runner services, as she shares:“I am so grateful for this courier service as they are the most polite courier service I have spoken to within the Edmonton area. They are incredibly personable and helpful. I was calling in not 100% knowing what I needed and they helped walk me through it and set me up an account. The fact that they have court running services and will even hot shot to Calgary are big bonuses to me using them at the company I am employed with. I should also mention how incredibly prompt they are! The court runners came much quicker than I expected and I have never waited past two rings when calling in.”Kendall Jackson is a long-time customer of ACS who enjoys the ease of online transactions.

Published in Saint John until 1815, then in Fredericton, it was the official paper in which the government announced appointments and printed notices of new legislation. In the early days, like the official Gazette in most colonies, it functioned somewhat like a newspaper, but marriage and death notices were limited to very important people and the best most family historians can hope for is some paid announcement about an estate. Other publishers in the main settlements soon filled the vacuum: in Saint John the Saint John Gazette (1784-1807) and the New Brunswick Courier (1811-1865), were among the earliest, and in Chatham, the Chatham Mercury (1826-1829) then the Gleaner (1829-1880) served the whole Mirimichi and Northumberland County area. The numbers of newspapers, mostly weekly or semi-weekly proliferated in the late 19th and early 20th century. The contents of these papers were in large part reprinted from British or American sources, but the editorial, a couple of columns of local news, some death and marriage announcements (very few births) and the advertising or notices by local businesses will offer a good record of community affairs. James A. Fraser’s history of Chatham, By Favourable Winds, makes extensive use of the newspaper notices and advertising in his biographical listing of the residents of the town and is a good example of what to look for beyond the begats.[1]Many early newspapers mention marriages, deaths, and a few births. J. Russell Harper's Historical Directory of New Brunswick Newspapers and Periodicals lists the different newspapers in New Brunswick and tells where they can be found.

They have all New Brunswick newspapers and also make clippings files by subject from the four provincial dailies “concerning public issues and the activities of the New Brunswick government” so it appears unlikely these will be of use to genealogists.[3]French-language Newspapers[edit | edit source]The Acadian population has been less well-served, but there were two papers published in the Moncton area: Le Moniteur Acadien (1867-1926) and L’Evangeline (1887-1982). The Université de Moncton, CENTER FOR ACADIAN STUDIES ANSELME-CHIASSON has published Inventaire du “Moniteur acadien,” 1867-1926, a selective index of articles of Acadian interest, and those with genealogical and family history information. Check their webpage and lists of publications to see what other more recent indexing has been published. There are some, for limited time spans, and you might be lucky and find they include the years you want. In Bathurst, LAC lists Le courrier des Provinces Maritimes published from 1885 to 1899 and 1900 to 1903, as well as many short-lived local publications that sprang up in the 1980s to replace L’Evangeline. If you need to locate French-language newspapers, consult the Centre d’Études acadiennes at the Université de Moncton.Le Centre d'études acadiennes(Center for Acadian Studies)Université de Moncton Moncton, NB E1A 3E9 CANADA Telephone: 506-858-4085 Fax: 506-858-4086 Library WebsiteGreat War Project[edit | edit source]New Brunswick Great War Project""With the enlistment from the province of 1,134 men to the first contingent, enthusiasm for war remained strong throughout the province. Whether driven by a sense of adventure, the need to combat injustice, love of Empire, or a budding sense of nationality, as many as 26,000 New Brunswick-born men and women would eventually wear the uniform of one of the Maritimes’ many distinctive military units. Approximately one in ten did not return. ""As casualties mounted, New Brunswickers found ways to deal with the increasing cost of war: charities were formed to help support soldiers’ families; agricultural societies banded together to find new ways to increase production; and, as volunteerism began to wane, recruiting associations gave way to conscription as a means of winning the war. Some New Brunswickers openly doubted the province’s ability to give more; but even in the darkest days of 1917 and 1918, most residents remained resolute in their desire to secure victory and to bring their loved ones home.""The New Brunswick Great War Project (NBGWP) is an ongoing program to preserve and illustrate a collection of sources relating to this province’s commitment to the Great War (1914-1919). Its principal aim is to provide both researcher and genealogist alike the foundation for a better understanding of the relationship between war and society. The project is not a comprehensive study of all people and all sources. It is an attempt to lend context to what is arguably a very complex subject. While great effort has been made to balance local with provincial topics, the project is heavily biased towards those sources dealing with military personnel, their families, and the wartime activities they engaged in.The project is divided into two separate but equally important parts: The first provides the names and vital statistics of approximately 32,000 soldiers and nurses of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) who are linked to New Brunswick’s military effort.The second part of the project provides users with 106,000 articles drawn from eight provincial newspapers, namely the Kings County Record, the St. John Standard, Fredericton’s Daily Gleaner, the Campbellton Graphic, the Daily Telegraph and the Sun(Saint John), the Daily Times(Moncton), the North Shore Leader(Newcastle), and the Tribune(Campbellton). Articles, ranging in date from 1914 to 1920, cover a number of important wartime issues. The largest category of clippings details the extent of New Brunswick’s military contribution to the Great War, from recruiting to the publication of personal letters and the twice-daily casualty list. Other categories include charitable fundraising, politics, economic expansion, the role of women and children, and the influence of religion. ""[4]References[edit | edit source]↑ Douglas, Althea.

Dated the 29th day of March, 1817.JOHN ROBINSON, CHARLES I. PETERS, JOHN MOUNT. City Gazette, reprinted in New Brunswick Courier, 27 May 1817Abridged Transcript:We are happy to learn, that the Freshet in the River St. John, has fallen rapidly within these few days – It had risen higher this season we believe, than ever recollected by the oldest inhabitants to have done before – much damage has been sustained by the farmers on the interval lands – carrying away barns, out-houses, fences, &c.; and materially injuring their dwellings. – We are however pleased to say that the country otherwise has a fine appearance, and every thing indicates a prosperous season. The wise and praiseworthy measures adopted by our Legislature at their last Session, has in a great degree alleviated the distresses of those who were destitute of the means of procuring either seed or even articles for their immediate consumption by which few indeed, comparatively speaking, suffered any real distress. – City Gazette. NiCHE encourages comments and constructive discussion of our articles.

Steve K 							Your driver Hazmat training program is fantastic! Every driver who comes to pick up a load is prepared and always knows the rules. This will be my second year shipping with you guys and I wouldn’t look anywhere else. Thank You for the amazing service!						Laura PRequest a QuoteIf you are shipping to Northwest Territories, you may encounter that most quotes provided by freight companies are in the high range and do not always offer the type of service that fits the needs of your project. At TransportationServices.ca we offer a wide selection of options to fit your needs.The most popular service we provide is flatbed trucking. Our flatbed trucks are of the highest quality and we regularly monitor their functioning to ensure it is thoroughly successful.

Our Hazmat trucks are equipped with the latest technology and we monitor all the aspects of the vehicle to ensure its proper functioning throughout the trip.

No load is too difficult for us as we have vast experience in all types of items.Our reefer trucking service also features excellently equipped trucks. We monitor the functioning of the refrigerators before every trip to ensure they work as required and to guarantee the safety of the load. If your products require another type of temperature controlled transport, we can also offer heated trucks.If you are in need of these specialized services but don’t need a full truck for your endeavors, we can also offer LTL trucking, which allows you to benefit from the use of a freight company while not requiring to get a full container.

Canada’s three territories include the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and the Yukon. You may be surprised to learn that the Northwest Territories is the diamond capital of North America, Nunavut didn’t even exist until 1999, and due to its close proximity to the Arctic Circle, the Yukon has one day a year where they experience 24 hours of sun and one day where the sun remains hidden. In comparison to Ontario, which boasts a population of over 14 million people, the Northwest Territories has a population of approximately 44,598 citizens, while the Yukon has just over 40,000, and Nunavut has just over 38,700.But beyond any interesting facts and figures that define the nuances of these territories, they also have unique logistical requirements. How exactly can businesses ship goods to our northern counterparts? After all, if a business chooses to service Canada, surely they can’t leave the territories behind?Over the past few years, Mactrans Logistics has had the opportunity to facilitate shipments to Nunavut, and the experience has proved to be a rather notable challenge with no shortage of lessons learned.You may be surprised to learn that citizens of Nunavut can only receive goods via air or, when ‘the arctic seas have thawed’, by boat. Unlike the seamless convenience and instant gratification offered to citizens living in major city centres like Toronto and Quebec, fast shipping is a relatively foreign concept. Last year, The Guardian published an article titled, ‘Why people in Canada’s remote Arctic capital are obsessed with Amazon Prime’ which detailed the intricacies associated with the shipment process for remote Arctic communities. The piece centered around a man named Iguptaq, who had grown up in Igluligaarjuk, a town of just 500 people.“Iguptaq had grown up in Igluligaarjuk, a town of just 500 people on the north-western coast of the Hudson Bay, so for him Iqaluit – with a population of almost 8,000 – was the big city. And among its perks was access to online shopping, whose free shipping deal has become crucial to many in Canada’s remotest territorial capital.”Why is it so hard to ship to these areas, you might wonder? Well, to start with, there are no roads or rail lines into Nunavut. The citizens who live in this territory often reside in remote locations, where the concept of a “close neighbour” is long forgotten. In many cases, there are very few urban centres close to where a citizen resides. This, coupled with the frigid climate, makes it nearly impossible to establish the supply chain infrastructure that we have come to rely on in surrounding urban centres and densely populated Canadian cities.For supply chain professionals, this proves to be a rather significant obstacle. One which requires the help of a sealift, barge, jet or highly-specialized transportation service. Throughout our experience, we’ve been able to learn the different gateways into the territory in order to deliver the freight to waiting customers. For example, we quickly learned that certain parts of Nunavut do not service flights from Ottawa, but will service flights out of Edmonton. The community of Taloyoak is so distanced away from Iqaluit, shipments require the use of the Edmonton Gateway, as do remote locations in Yukon and the Northwest Territories.With this in mind, close coordination with airlines is essential to successful shipping, and communicate frequently with carriers to ensure the parcel is — quite literally — signed, sealed, and delivered, despite the long and often complicated trek. In the case of land-locked islands, we often fill up containers and place them on barges in August, which means the citizens and businesses of these territories may only receive shipments during select months/timeframes each year.Understandably, shipping products across such expansive terrain becomes a rather costly expenditure, which also explains why the cost of living in Nunavut is among the highest in the country. Air cargo is notoriously the most expensive option and is often only utilized for select cargo or in emergency/time-constrained situationsAlthough some companies may place limitations on their shipping capabilities due to these challenges, many brands are still willing to service these remote populations. From personal goods to groceries, household items and furniture, construction equipment and more, select providers work alongside transportation management companies like ours to service these norther territories by air or sea. Mactrans Logistics now offers services to Yukon, North West Territories and Nunavut.Fortunately, the proposed development of a new deepwater port in 2021 has provided Nunavut locals and logistic providers, that the delays and complications so commonly experience throughout this unique supply chain will soon be a thing of the past.

Your driver was professional and your dispatchers are on-the-ball. I will definitely recommend your company.

Canada’s three territories include the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and the Yukon. You may be surprised to learn that the Northwest Territories is the diamond capital of North America, Nunavut didn’t even exist until 1999, and due to its close proximity to the Arctic Circle, the Yukon has one day a year where they experience 24 hours of sun and one day where the sun remains hidden. In comparison to Ontario, which boasts a population of over 14 million people, the Northwest Territories has a population of approximately 44,598 citizens, while the Yukon has just over 40,000, and Nunavut has just over 38,700.But beyond any interesting facts and figures that define the nuances of these territories, they also have unique logistical requirements. How exactly can businesses ship goods to our northern counterparts? After all, if a business chooses to service Canada, surely they can’t leave the territories behind?Over the past few years, Mactrans Logistics has had the opportunity to facilitate shipments to Nunavut, and the experience has proved to be a rather notable challenge with no shortage of lessons learned.You may be surprised to learn that citizens of Nunavut can only receive goods via air or, when ‘the arctic seas have thawed’, by boat. Unlike the seamless convenience and instant gratification offered to citizens living in major city centres like Toronto and Quebec, fast shipping is a relatively foreign concept. Last year, The Guardian published an article titled, ‘Why people in Canada’s remote Arctic capital are obsessed with Amazon Prime’ which detailed the intricacies associated with the shipment process for remote Arctic communities. The piece centered around a man named Iguptaq, who had grown up in Igluligaarjuk, a town of just 500 people.“Iguptaq had grown up in Igluligaarjuk, a town of just 500 people on the north-western coast of the Hudson Bay, so for him Iqaluit – with a population of almost 8,000 – was the big city. And among its perks was access to online shopping, whose free shipping deal has become crucial to many in Canada’s remotest territorial capital.”Why is it so hard to ship to these areas, you might wonder? Well, to start with, there are no roads or rail lines into Nunavut. The citizens who live in this territory often reside in remote locations, where the concept of a “close neighbour” is long forgotten. In many cases, there are very few urban centres close to where a citizen resides. This, coupled with the frigid climate, makes it nearly impossible to establish the supply chain infrastructure that we have come to rely on in surrounding urban centres and densely populated Canadian cities.For supply chain professionals, this proves to be a rather significant obstacle. One which requires the help of a sealift, barge, jet or highly-specialized transportation service. Throughout our experience, we’ve been able to learn the different gateways into the territory in order to deliver the freight to waiting customers. For example, we quickly learned that certain parts of Nunavut do not service flights from Ottawa, but will service flights out of Edmonton. The community of Taloyoak is so distanced away from Iqaluit, shipments require the use of the Edmonton Gateway, as do remote locations in Yukon and the Northwest Territories.With this in mind, close coordination with airlines is essential to successful shipping, and communicate frequently with carriers to ensure the parcel is — quite literally — signed, sealed, and delivered, despite the long and often complicated trek. In the case of land-locked islands, we often fill up containers and place them on barges in August, which means the citizens and businesses of these territories may only receive shipments during select months/timeframes each year.Understandably, shipping products across such expansive terrain becomes a rather costly expenditure, which also explains why the cost of living in Nunavut is among the highest in the country. Air cargo is notoriously the most expensive option and is often only utilized for select cargo or in emergency/time-constrained situationsAlthough some companies may place limitations on their shipping capabilities due to these challenges, many brands are still willing to service these remote populations. From personal goods to groceries, household items and furniture, construction equipment and more, select providers work alongside transportation management companies like ours to service these norther territories by air or sea. Mactrans Logistics now offers services to Yukon, North West Territories and Nunavut.Fortunately, the proposed development of a new deepwater port in 2021 has provided Nunavut locals and logistic providers, that the delays and complications so commonly experience throughout this unique supply chain will soon be a thing of the past.

The Alabama Courier (Athens, Alabama) [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2003.Original data: The Alabama Courier. Athens, AL, USA. Database created from microfilm copies of the newspaper.About The Alabama Courier (Athens, Alabama)The Alabama Courier newspaper was located in Athens, Alabama. This database is a fully searchable text version of the newspaper for the following years: 1931, 1941, 1942, 1944-1949, and 1968. The newspapers can be browsed or searched using a computer-generated index. The accuracy of the index varies according to the quality of the original images. The images for this newspaper can be browsed sequentially, or via links to specific images, which may be obtained through the search results. Over time, the name of a newspaper may have changed and the time span it covered may not always be consistent. The date range represented in this database is not necessarily the complete published set available. Check the local library or historical society in the area in which your ancestors lived for more information about other available newspapers.Newspapers can be used to find valuable genealogical information about historical events in the lives of our ancestors. They supply all sorts of clues about vital statistics (birth, marriage, and death announcements), obituaries, local news, biographical sketches, legal notices, immigration, migration, and shipping information and other historical items that place our ancestors in the context of the society in which they lived.Newspapers are intended for general readers, usually serve a geographic region, and may also be oriented toward a particular ethnic, cultural, social, or political group. Newspapers record the day-to-day or even week-to-week happenings of local community events. They act almost as a diary for events that took place in a certain locality.Because newspapers are generally geographic in scope they are not limited to governmental jurisdictions; therefore, they can include such things as the report of a wedding of local citizens, even when it occurred in a neighboring county or even another state.  Newspapers can also provide at least a partial substitute for nonexistent civil records. For example, an obituary may have appeared in a newspaper even when civil death records did not exist. Newspapers are not restricted to or bound by the regulations or forms used by more ""official"" sources. Additionally, because newspapers are unofficial sources, even when they merely supplement the public records, they can provide much incidental information that is simply not recorded anywhere else. For example, a newspaper account of a marriage might indicate that it took place at the home of the bride's parents, perhaps even naming them; it might list the occupation of the groom, or indicate that the ceremony was part of a double wedding in which the bride's sister was also married. These types of details are not likely to appear on a marriage record at the local courthouse.While newspapers created in large cities were most often concerned with international, national, and state affairs they can contain valuable information about local individuals and should not be passed over.  In contrast, small country or community newspapers were concerned with local people and their immediate surroundings and are often rich in genealogical and historical information.Newspapers are wonderful sources and should not be missed!Taken from ""Chapter 12: Research in Newspapers,"" The Source: A Guidebook of American Genealogy by James L.

It is owned by Community Newspaper Holdings Inc.Today's News Courier was created in 1969, when The Alabama Courier (founded 1892) and the Limestone Democrat (founded 1891) were acquired by Robert Bryan and merged. The combined paper was known in the 1980s as The Athens LC News Courier. Bryan sold his papers to Hollinger in 1997. When Hollinger dispersed of most of its papers, The News Courier was acquired by Community Newspaper Holdings, now known as CNHI, LLC.[1]The News Courier was a daily newspaper through the early 2010s, then reduced to six print editions per week. In April 2020, amid severe downturns in advertising revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic, CNHI reduced the print-edition schedule to Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.Contents1 Awards1.1 2018 Better Newspaper Contest - Alabama Press Association[2]2 References3 External linksAwards[edit]2018 Better Newspaper Contest - Alabama Press Association[2][edit]YearAwardPlaceRecipient2018Best Local Sports Column3rdJeff Edwards2018Best News Photo3rdJessica Barnett2018Best Niche Publication - Newsprint or Glossy1stJeff EdwardsReferences[edit]^ Former Owner Of The Cullman Times Dies^ Langan, Jaclyn.

Italy   Italy           Ho spedito più pacchi tramite europacco e mi sono sempre trovata bene. Prezzo contenuto, sempre veloce, mai nessun problema.Ottimo servizio.     Italy   Denmark          There were few difficutlties with Europacco suppliers who did the pick up ( one day late with no info). I made a complain and europacco c.service followed the whole chain properly again...  with their supplier. We received everything in perfect condition and on time. Europacco was sorry for this and provided a prompt solution. The guy who delivered it to me ( another supplier) called me to gently ask if he could avoid to come up to the 3rd floor, this is quite common here form different supplier, I would have loved to help, but with 2 small kids home that is a no go, therfore I decided as well for an home delivery. So even if it was clear the service I paid, that was a "" try"" to avoid the hard work, but I do not blame Europacco for that. In general I am really happy with europacco service and I will use it in the future.  more info        We are always there for you!  info@europacco.com          Your shipments  Enter package dimensions  We still have a request!

The information may vary for personal and commercial shipments.Any issues with customs clearance can cause delays, additional duty charges or even confiscation of items should it warrant.

50,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_California_Courier,"The California Courier - WikipediaThe California CourierFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to navigationJump to searchThe California Courier is an English-language Armenian weekly newspaper published since 1958 in the United States. Its publisher is Harut Sassounian.[1]Contents1 History2 See also3 References4 External linksHistory[edit]In 1958, The California Courier was founded in Fresno, California by George J. Mason (born Kevork Elmassian) and Reese Cleghorn.[2][3] Unlike some other Armenian weekly newspapers in the United States, the Courier was published entirely in English and marketed to an audience and generation of Armenian-Americans whose primary language was not Armenian. The paper's mission was to shed light on recent developments within Armenian-American communities, encourage greater involvement within those communities, and address intracommunal issues impartially, without associating with or being sponsored by an Armenian diasporan political party.[4]As the Courier relocated from Fresno to Los Angeles in 1983, the mantle of editor-in-chief was passed to Harut Sassounian, who publishes the paper to this day.[5]See also[edit]History of the Armenian Americans in Los AngelesReferences[edit]^ Schrader, Esther (March 9, 1989).

Yet, shipping companies do not have the ability to find out exactly when a delivery person or a carrier will arrive at a specific location. The volume of mail and parcels fluctuates daily; therefore, delivery times are not guaranteed. Unusual circumstances (such as traffic, staffing fluctuations, severe weather, natural disaster, changes in carrier route, etc.) can cause deliveries to be made after this time. Meanwhile, you can track the status of your package through Track a PKG website.3https://trackapkg.com/californiacourierservices-tracking-number1My package with California Courier Services is late, what should I do?The shipment is due now.Delivery time varies from one class of mail to another. It may be possible that the package is still in transit and is not lost or delayed depending on what class of mail is being used and how long ago it was mailed. So, firstly check the status of the shipment at Track a PKG. This gives you full visibility regarding your shipment's transit status. Secondly, if the shipment's delivery is out of the expected delivery window, you can contact California Courier Services's customer service: http://www.californiacourierservices.com/.3https://trackapkg.com/californiacourierservices-tracking-number1Where do I get the tracking number of my California Courier Services shipment?I want to track my California Courier Services shipment but I don't know where to get the tracking number.The tracking number is given to the sender when they make the shipping order with California Courier Services.

This was important because mail delivery often included multiple couriers in varying environmental circumstances, which made it possible for a mail to get lost.Track a PKG offers a quick way to track trace your package. It contains most of the global couriers as well as local shipping providers and post/EMS companies. If you don't find your shipping courier, please contact us so that we add it to the service.

It considers the circulation of what was arguably the most important commodity throughout the Julfan network: information. It offers the first scholarly treatment of the art of Julfan business correspondence by examining thousands of business and family letters written by Julfan merchants in their unique dialect of mercantile Armenian. In addition to analyzing the stylistic properties of Julfan correspondence and assessing the economic function of letter writing and information sharing, the chapter also looks at the role of correspondence in helping create an “imagined community” of merchants who were scattered in different parts of the world. finally, it addresses the role of Julfan courier networks, which acted as a private order postal system and delivered information and news to Julfan merchants and their families, thus gluing merchants in different settlements together and the settlements to their “nodal center” in New Julfa.Keywords:			 			New Julfa, settlements, trade network, business correspondence, letters, merchants, information sharing, imagined community, courier networks, newsCalifornia Scholarship Online requires a subscription or purchase to access the full text of books within the service.

The national language of Micronesia is English and Micronesia's gross national income is US $2860.	Unlike other nations within the geographic region of Micronesia such as the Marshall Islands and Kiribati, we can often expect delivery at three to four days from the date of delivery for the premium DHL service or four to five days with our own service.	You should be aware that the islands charge duties on certain personal items that are imported.

104,https://www.ship24.com/couriers/micronesia-post-tracking,"MICRONESIA POST Tracking | Track Micronesia Post Parcel & Shipment Delivery - Ship24 Ship from China  NEW  Couriers  Shops  Help SolutionsEnglish Micronesia Post tracking Do you live in Micronesia? Do you need to send a package to another country? Well, you should know that you just have to go to Micronesia Post, the official postal and package delivery service of the country. And if you do not know how to use their services, or you do not have much information about them, no problem. Because below you will see everything you need to know about the Micronesia Post tracking services.From their postal services, Micronesia Post tracking online system, how to send a package without problems, and even the rates they currently handle. Everything you may need, you will find below, so do not stop reading, because the following information may seem very valuable if you live in this nation.What is the Micronesia Post?Micronesia Post is the postal, delivery, and collection service of the Federated States of Micronesia. It was born as a part of the United States Postal Service, because this nation is considered part of the USA, so you will notice both services have a lot in common.Currently, they have offices in Pohnpei, Palikir, Chuuk, among other places in Micronesia. Besides, it works with USPS prices, in addition to its conditions and services for international shipments. Therefore, you can find a lot of similarities in both parcel shipping offices, as they belong to the same nation, technically.However, you have not come here to find a review on Micronesia Post, but to find out details about its products and services. So keep reading below, so you know everything you need to know about this government company, even about the Micronesia Post tracking online service.Is it possible to track a package sent with Micronesia Post?Of course, like any other postal and courier service, Micronesia Post has its own tracking numbers. However, at the moment they do not have a specific page to do Micronesia Post tracking online, but this is not an impediment, you will see why. Since Micronesia is considered part of the United States, its postal system is also part of that nation.This means that you can use any tracking page to find your packages shipped with Micronesia Post, such as the USPS. Just have the Micronesia Post tracking number handy, place it on the web page, and select the search button to start the tracking of the parcel. In a short time, you will see all the information you need about your package appear on the screen.And be careful, this does not mean Micronesia Post has poor services but works in conjunction with the US Postal Service. So you can understand they run tracking systems in common, something that makes it much easier for Micronesians to find their packages with the Micronesia Post tracking number.The other solution to track your package from the Micronesia Post is to use a universal tracking tool like Ship24, much easier and faster.How long does it take for the FSM Postal service to deliver?As for FSM postal service shipping time, this depends on many factors, just like any other courier service. First of all, shipping services within Micronesia may be fast, unless they are shipping between islands. In any case, shipments can take between 24 hours to about 5 business days. Something perfectly normal for any postal company.While the FSM postal service shipping time for international shipments, provided in a partnership with USPS, may take a little longer. And of course, this depends on the country where you want to send your package, so the more remote countries have longer delivery times. On the opposite, countries closer to Oceania could take much less time.Anyways, on average, FSM postal service shipping time for international deliveries ranges from 5 days to 30 business days.Is the Micronesian Post expensive?You should know that Micronesia Post has specific rates for Mail Boxes and package receptions in Micronesia, but it is also administered by the USPS rates for international shipments. So let's start with the Micronesia Post shipping prices for receiving packages through the Mails Boxes.So, a small Micronesia Post package could cost $ 30, while medium packages arrive at a cost of $50, and large packages can cost about $55. Lastly, extra-long packages can cost $70. Remember, all these prices are in Micronesian currency, and of course, for heavier or larger packages, there are slightly higher rates.Now, let's talk a little about the USPS rates, which as we already mentioned, are the same as those of the Micronesia Post. In this case:Express shipments cost up to $ 26.65 for small packagesWhile larger packages, up to 70 pounds, can cost about $ 210.Take into consideration that these prices are in US dollars, and do not include other customs fees, taxes, or the cost of stamps.Does Micronesia Post only deliver in Micronesia?As we already mentioned, Micronesia Post tracking service has an Alliance with USPS, so you can ship to other countries from Micronesia. However, remember this is a government service of the Federated States of Micronesia, so they only work within these islands. In short, no, you will not find this service in other countries.But do not worry, because all countries have their own courier services, so you just have to look for the one that best suits your needs and requirements.Does the Micronesia Post have customer service?Of course, you just have to go to the official Micronesia Post page, in the ""Contact Us"" section, and it will direct you to a page with a contact form. There, you can put your data, your email, and the comments you want to make to the company. In a short time, you will receive an answer from the Micronesia Post customer service to your email.On the other hand, you can also contact them through a phone call at (691) 320-2614. But remember that it is a number from Micronesia, so use it if you are within the islands.

But you would be wrong. I have a UPS return, I went to drop of the package and was turned away because they need a special UPS label in order to accept it, the ground label isn't good enough for them to accept. I contacted the company regarding this special label and they said no because its additional shipping fee that they would have to pay. if I pay it it would cost more than the idea I am trying to return. Grrrr. So, now if I want my money back. I have to put this package in a USPS box to ship it off island at my expense.

Lix | Burkhart-Ziegler Funeral Chapel | Dodge City, KansasWe started doing business with Metro Courier due to lack of mail service time frame.

According to the 1999 Editor & Publisher International Yearbook, the paper is the 48th-largest daily paper in the United States.[needs update]Contents1 History1.1 Origins1.2 Watterson era1.3 Bingham ownership1.4 Gannett ownership2 Awards2.1 Pulitzer Prize3 Other notable staff4 See also5 References6 Further reading7 External linksHistory[edit]Origins[edit]The Courier-Journal was created from the merger of several newspapers introduced in Kentucky in the 19th century.Pioneer paper The Focus of Politics, Commerce and Literature, was founded in 1826 in Louisville when the city was an early settlement of less than 7,000 individuals.  In 1830 a new newspaper, The Louisville Daily Journal, began distribution in the city and, in 1832, absorbed The Focus of Politics, Commerce and Literature. The Journal was an organ of the Whig Party, founded and edited by George D. Prentice, a New Englander who initially came to Kentucky to write a biography of Henry Clay.[4] Prentice would edit the Journal for more than 40 years.In 1844, another newspaper, the Louisville Morning Courier was founded in Louisville by Walter Newman Haldeman. The Louisville Daily Journal and the Louisville Morning Courier were the news leaders in Louisville and were politically opposed throughout the Civil War; The Journal was against slavery while the Courier was pro-Confederacy. The Courier was suppressed by the Union and had to move to Nashville, but returned to Louisville after the war.Upon President Abraham Lincoln issuing the Emancipation Proclamation that ended slavery in the Confederate states, the Journal opposed the Proclamation as an unconstitutional use of presidential power and predicted: ""Kentucky cannot and will not acquiesce in this measure. Never!""[5][6]In 1868, an ailing Prentice persuaded the 28-year-old Henry Watterson to come edit for the Journal. During secret negotiations in 1868, The Journal and the Courier merged and the first edition of The Courier-Journal was delivered to Louisvillians on Sunday morning, November 8, 1868.Watterson era[edit] Editorial staff of The Courier-Journal, 1868.Henry Watterson, the son of a Tennessee congressman, had written for Harper's Magazine and the New York Times before enlisting in the Confederate Army. He became nationally known for his work as The Courier-Journal emerged as the region's leading paper. He supported the Democratic Party and pushed for the industrialization of Kentucky and the South in general, notably through urging the Southern Exposition be held in Louisville. He attracted controversy for attempting to prove that Christopher Marlowe had actually written the works of Shakespeare. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1917 for editorials demanding the United States enter World War I.[7]The Courier-Journal founded a companion afternoon edition of the paper, The Louisville Times, in May 1884. In 1896, Watterson and Haldeman opposed Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan over his support of ""Free Silver"" coinage. This unpopular decision upset readers and advertisers, many of whom pulled their support for The Courier-Journal. Kentucky voted for the Republican candidate in 1896, the first time in state history, and local political leaders blamed the Courier. Only the popularity of The Louisville Times, which had no strong editorial reputation, saved the newspaper company from bankruptcy. The Courier supported Bryan in future elections.[7]Haldeman had owned the papers until his death in 1902, and by 1917 they were owned by his son, William, and Henry Watterson.Bingham ownership[edit] Courier-Journal offices in downtown Louisville, built during the Bingham eraOn August 8, 1918, Robert Worth Bingham purchased two-thirds interest in the newspapers and acquired the remaining stock in 1920. The liberal Bingham clashed with longtime editor Watterson, who remained on board, but was in the twilight of his career. Watterson's editorials opposing the League of Nations appeared alongside Bingham's favoring it, and Watterson finally retired on April 2, 1919.[7]I have always regarded the newspapers owned by me as a public trust and have endeavored so to conduct them as to render the greatest public service.— Robert Worth BinghamAs publisher, Bingham set the tone for his editorial pages, and pushed for improved public education, support of African Americans and the poor of Appalachia. In 1933, the newspapers passed to his son, Barry Bingham, Sr. Barry Bingham would continue in his father's footsteps, guiding the editorial page and modernizing the paper by setting up several news bureaus throughout the state, expanding the news staff. During Barry Bingham, Sr.'s tenure, the paper was considered Kentucky's ""Newspaper of Record"" and consistently ranked among the 10 best in the nation.[7]In 1971, Barry Bingham, Jr. succeeded his father as the newspapers' editor and publisher.The Binghams were well-liked owners popularly credited with being more concerned with publishing quality journalism than making heavy profits. They also owned the leading local radio and television stations – WHAS-TV, WHAS-AM, and WAMZ-FM—and Standard Gravure, a rotogravure printing company that printed The Courier-Journal's Sunday Magazine as well as similar magazines for other newspapers.Barry Bingham Jr. sought to free the papers from conflicts of interests, and through The Louisville Times, experimented with new ideas such as signed editorials. Bingham Jr. also parted with tradition by endorsing several Republican candidates for office.[7]In 1974, Carol Sutton became managing editor of The Courier-Journal, the first woman appointed to such a post at a major US daily newspaper. Under the leadership of C. Thomas Hardin, director of photography, the combined photography staff of The Courier-Journal and Louisville Times was awarded the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography for its coverage of school desegregation in Louisville.Barry Bingham, Jr. served as editor and publisher until he resigned in 1986, shortly after his father announced that the newspaper company was for sale, in large measure because of disagreements between Bingham Jr. and his sister Sallie.Gannett ownership[edit]This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (March 2017) On January 8, 1986, Barry Bingham Sr. announced his intent to sell the family owned media properties including the Courier-Journal.[8] In July 1986, Gannett Company, Inc. purchased the newspaper company for $300 million, outbidding The Washington Post and the Tribune company.[9] Gannett appointed George N. Gill President and Publisher who had been with the newspaper and the Binghams for over two decades. Gill worked his way up from copy editor to Chief Executive Officer of the Bingham Companies.[10] In 1993, Gill retired and Edward E. Manassah became President and Publisher.[11]February 1987 saw the last publication of The Louisville Times, which like most afternoon papers had experienced declining readership; the news operations of the two papers had previously been consolidated under Gannett. The surviving Courier featured a strong news content increase by 29%.[12]In 1989, the paper's news staff won the Pulitzer Prize for general local reporting for what the Pulitzer board called ""exemplary initial coverage"" of a collision that was the nation's worst drunk-driving crash and school-bus accident. In 2005, cartoonist Nick Anderson won the paper's 10th Pulitzer, but when he left for the Houston Chronicle, the paper did not replace him, instead relying largely on submissions from local cartoonists. One, lawyer Marc Murphy, has become a near-regular and gained respect for his work.The newspaper resumed polling on elections, and began video streaming its editorial-board conferences with major candidates, under Publisher Arnold ""Arnie"" Garson, who came from the Argus Leader, Gannett's paper in Sioux Falls, S.D., in late 2008. Garson is an outspoken promoter of the future of printed newspapers in the digital age. Under him, the paper began keeping occasional major stories or sports columns off its website and promoting them as print exclusives. Most of these have run on Sundays; in July 2009, Garson announced that the paper's Sunday home-delivery circulation was up 0.5 percent over the previous year.Awards[edit]Pulitzer Prize[edit]YearCategoryRecipientFor1918Editorial WritingHenry WattersonFor his two World War I editorials ""War Has Its Compensations"" (April 10, 1918), and ""Vae Victis!""

External Websites                Official Site of the Courier-JournalBy			The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica										•				Edit HistoryThe Courier-Journal,  morning daily newspaper published in Louisville, Kentucky, long recognized as one of the outstanding regional newspapers of the United States.It was founded in 1868 by a merger of the Louisville Courier and the Louisville Journal brought about by Henry Watterson, The Courier-Journal’s first editor, who also became a part owner. Watterson was an eloquent writer and a veteran of the Confederate army in the Civil War who greatly admired Abraham Lincoln and who believed in political participation by blacks. His half-century tenure as editor brought The Courier-Journal nationwide distinction for its thorough coverage and for having the strength of its sometimes unpopular convictions. It was a leading voice in the creation of what eventually became known as the New South.Liberal and Democratic in its editorial outlook, The Courier-Journal supported progressive causes while stressing national and international news coverage. Under Watterson, and later under the Bingham family, it was an influential force in Democratic Party presidential nominations and in the politics of the state and region. Its support of equal rights and opportunities for blacks, progressive in the context of southern politics, was as conspicuous in the 1960s and 1970s as it had been 100 years before during the Reconstruction era. The newspaper was purchased by the Gannett Co., Inc., in 1986. "

According to the 1999 Editor & Publisher International Yearbook, the paper is the 48th largest daily paper in the United States and the single largest in Kentucky. The Courier-Journal also owns the alternative weekly paper Velocity, which is provided free of charge.Contents1 History1.1 Origins1.2 Watterson era1.3 Bingham ownership1.4 Gannett ownership2 Initiative Coverage3 Awards3.1 Pulitzer Prize4 Footnotes5 Additional reading6 External linksHistoryOriginsThe Courier-Journal was created from the merger of several newspapers introduced in Kentucky in the 1800s.Pioneer paper The Focus of Politics, Commerce and Literature, was founded in 1826 in Louisville when the city was an early settlement of less than 7,000 individuals.  In 1830 a new newspaper, The Louisville Daily Journal, began distribution in the city and, in 1832, absorbed The Focus of Politics, Commerce and Literature. The Journal was an organ of the Whig Party, founded and edited by George D. Prentice, a New Englander who initially came to Kentucky to write a biography of Henry Clay. Prentice would edit the Journal for more than 40 years.In 1844, another newspaper, the Louisville Morning Courier was founded in Louisville by Walter N. Haldeman. The Louisville Daily Journal and the Louisville Morning Courier were the news leaders in Louisville and were politically opposed throughout the Civil War; The Journal was against slavery while the Courier was pro-Confederacy. The Courier was suppressed by the Union and had to move to Nashville, but returned to Louisville after the war.In 1868, an ailing Prentice persuaded the 28-year-old Henry Waterson to come edit to the Journal. During secret negotiations in 1868, The Journal and the Courier merged and the first edition of The Courier-Journal was delivered to Louisvillians on Sunday morning, 8 November, 1868.Watterson eraHenry Watterson, the son of a Tennessee congressman, had written for Harper's Magazine and the New York Times before enlisting in the Confederate Army. He became nationally known for his work as the Courier-Journal emerged as the region's leading paper. He supported the Democratic Party and pushed for the industrialization of Kentucky and the South in general, notably through urging the Southern Exposition be held in Louisville. He attracted controversy for attempting to prove that Christopher Marlowe had actually written the works of Shakespeare. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1917 for editorials demanding the United States enter World War I.[1]The Courier-Journal founded a companion afternoon edition of the paper, The Louisville Times, in May 1884. In 1896, Watterson and Haldeman opposed Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan over his support of ""Free Silver"" coinage. This unpopular decision upset readers and advertisers, many of whom pulled their support for the Courier-Journal. Kentucky voted for the Republican candidate in 1896, the first time in state history, and local political leaders blamed the Courier. Only the popularity of the Louisville Times, which had no strong editorial reputation, saved the newspaper company from bankruptcy. The Courier supported Bryan in future elections.Haldeman had owned the papers until his death in 1902, and by 1917 they were owned by his son, William, and Henry Watterson.Bingham ownershipOn August 8 1918, Robert Worth Bingham purchased two-thirds interest in the newspapers and acquired the remaining stock in 1920. The liberal Bingham clashed with long-time editor Watterson, who remained on board, but was in the twilight of his career. Watterson's editorials opposing the League of Nations appeared alongside Bingham's favoring it, and Watterson finally retired on April 2 1919.As publisher, Bingham set the tone for his editorial pages, and pushed for improved public education, support of African Americans and the poor of Appalachia. In 1933, the newspapers passed to his son, Barry Bingham, Sr. Barry Bingham would continue in his fathers footsteps, guiding the editorial page and modernizing the paper by setting up several news bureaus throughout the state, expanded the news staff. During Barry Bingham, Sr.'s tenure, the paper was considered Kentucky's ""Newspaper of Record"" and consistently ranked among the ten best in the nation.In 1971, Barry Bingham, Jr. succeeded his father as the newspapers' editor and publisher. The Binghams were well-liked owners popularly credited with being more concerned with publishing quality journalism than making heavy profits. They also owned the WHAS TV and WHAS-AM and the Standard Gravure company which printed, among other things, the Courier-Journal. Barry Bingham Jr. sought to free the papers from conflicts of interests, and through the Louisville Times, experimented with new ideas such as signed editorials. Bingham Jr. also parted with tradition by endorsing several Republican candidates for office.In 1974, Carol Sutton became managing editor of the Courier-Journal, the first woman appointed to such a post at a major US daily newspaper. Under the leadership of C. Thomas Hardin, director of photography, the combined photography staff of the Courier-Journal and Louisville Times was awarded the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography for its coverage of school desegregation in Louisville.Barry Bingham, Jr. served as editor and publisher until he resigned in 1986, shortly after his father announced that the newspaper company was for sale.Gannett ownershipIn July 1986, Gannett|Gannett Company, Inc. purchased the newspaper company for $300 million and appointed George N. Gill President and Publisher. Gill had been with the newspaper and the Binghams for over two decades, working his way up from reporter to Chief Executive Officer of the Bingham Companies. In 1993, Gill retired and Edward E. Manassah became President and Publisher.In February 1987, publication of The Louisville Times, an afternoon publication that had experienced declining readership, ceased.As of 2005, the C-J has received ten Pulitzer Prizes and is read by an estimated 492,000 people daily and 670,900 people on Sundays.Initiative CoverageNo information yet.AwardsPulitzer PrizeYearCategoryRecipientFor1918Editorial WritingHenry WattersonFor his two World War I editorials ""War Has Its Compensation"" (10 April, 1918), and ""Vae Victis"" (17 May, 1918).1926ReportingWilliam Burke ""Skeets"" MillerFor his coverage of the attempts to rescue Floyd Collins trapped in Sand Cave, now part of Mammoth Cave National Park (February, 1925).1956Editorial CartooningRobert YorkFor his cartoon ""Achilles"" showing a bulging figure of American prosperity tapering to a weak heel labeled ""farm prices.""

One quarter of that trade passes through the Detroit-Windsor border along with more than 11,000 trucks and 15,000 cars. Courier companies in Canada and the US, including Vans LTL, are responsible for carrying some of the more than $1.6 million dollars in trade that crosses the Detroit-Windsor border every single minute. It is hardly surprising that the Detroit-Windsor border crossing is the busiest of all the Canada-US border points. There are 200 million people living within a 13-hour drive of the Detroit-Windsor border. Vans LTL is a courier service that gives you fast, affordable, hassle-free access to those potential customers, ensuring small businesses have the benefit of big markets, without big costs.Small loads, big businessWhile some companies need to ship a full truckload across the border, not everyone needs to move that much product. If you have one or two orders to fulfil your choices are often limited and costly. This is where VANS LTL can help. We are a courier service in Canada specializing in cross-border shipments. We cater to companies who need to get their product to market but do not have enough to fill a truck. For a small business, seeking out a trustworthy, cost-effective, and reliable shipping company in Canada often means paying far more than necessary with one of the mainstream parcel services.Navigating trade regulationsFor wholesalers, e-commerce companies and businesses who make multiple shipments across the border, finding a courier service in Canada can seem daunting. Many courier companies in Canada will take your package but leave you trying to navigate complicated cross-border trade regulations on your own or face additional fees after shipping. At Vans LTL we are a full serve courier company. We handle the co-ordination of pickup and delivery, crating your product, tailgate services, paperwork, insurance as well as finding a broker.What is LTL?LTL stands for Less Than a Truckload. When you need to ship product that is not enough to fill an entire truck or skid, it is the ideal type of courier service. Whether you have two shipments or two thousand, once a year or once a week we will save you money, headaches and cut your shipping costs.How we save you money• FASTER DELIVERY TIMESNo need to wait until you have enough customer orders to send a full truckload.• REDUCE ERRORSNavigating the rules of cross-border transit is complicated, but with Vans LTL, you gain access to our team of logistics experts who ensure your delivery arrives, right and on time. Vans LTL is a professional courier service with cross-border shipping experts on call Monday through Saturday. Getting your product where it needs to go is what we do.• PAY ONLY FOR WHAT YOU USENo more paying for the empty space in half-filled trucks. Orders are combined to speed up transit and save all customers the hassle of logistics.• BETTER RATESThe more frequently a shipping company delivers freight, the better their rates. By combining smaller orders into one load and shipping those frequently, we can get the best shipping rates and we pass those rates on to you.• BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENTBy combining shipments to move full truckloads, LTL shipping reduces the total number of trucks on the road thereby reducing emissions.• REDUCE WAREHOUSE COSTSWaiting until you have enough orders to warrant a full truckload often means storing product for long periods. That requires companies to have warehouse space, creating an added expense, particularly for small businesses. By using a courier service like Vans LTL, you ship your product more frequently, which means you can reduce storage space and warehouse costs.CALL US TODAY1.800.925.9253Shipping To USA | Shipping To CanadaFollow us on   © Copyright    |   All Rights Reserved   | Sitemap   |   Terms and Conditions   |   Privacy Statement   |    Web Design by WebGeeks                                   Go to Top  Courier Companies In Canada Courier Service Canada international shipping from Canada shipping companies in Canada News shipping to canada from US News Articles Horseback Riding Holidays  San Diego 3pl  Best Wine Preserver  last minute movers Manhattan  Turntable Pallet Wrapper  Mens League Golf Near Me  Clubs De Bateau  Rafting Medellin  Kissimmee Rental Home  Garage Ceiling Storage  Related Articles© 2022 Vans LTL Courier "

I had never hired a courier service before and needed to deliver some equipment that I couldn’t fit in my car. These guys were prompt, professional, and friendly. The courier picked up and delivered all within under an hour. Definitely wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them.Mason W.I’m beyond impressed with how quick Detroit Couriers responded to my request and completed it. I had a bit of an unusual request after FedEx messed up my shipment on the weekend, and they were there to pick up my package and deliver it in a fast manner. I was surprised since they were one of the only couriers that were still open on the weekends and managed to complete my delivery in a faster time than they originally promised.Steve W.Our company needed to transport pallets and large crates for a trade show that was a few states away due to a last minute shipping hiccup, so we were on a tight deadline. Detroit Couriers arranged a cargo van to come and pick up my pallets and boxes and delivered it to the trade show in time for us to set up. Thanks again guys.Michael B.We used these guys to transport some medical samples after our regular courier dropped the ball. They arrived earlier than expected and delivered the samples way quicker than our usual courier. We have since switched over to using Detroit Couriers for all of our medical sample and specimen deliveries. 5 stars!Daniel S.I am an out of town but needed some paperwork to be delivered to one of our clients and signed off on and then shipped back to me. I contacted Detroit Couriers and they not only got the job done right (even though their driver had to wait a bit more at the client’s place than expected) they also kept their promise and made sure everything got taken care of and sent back. I even received a digital copy of the document right away. Amazing courier service and if I need their services again I wouldn’t hesitate to use them.Annete F.I needed a same day filing in district court, and unfortunately the lawyer responsible for it wanted the most amount of time to complete it before filing. I called Detroit Couriers and they printed up my filing and then took it to the clerk of courts and had it filed in under an hour, during rush hour traffic. For any legal filings in Detroit I couldn’t recommend them anymore.Nathan B.My company uses them for all of our STAT medical deliveries. We are talking samples, devices, trays with equipment that need cleaning, and implants and we have never had any complaints. Not only do these guys follow through with every order they also make sure all of our deliveries get the highest priority which means that our STAT orders aren’t waiting for a driver to come by to pick up and deliver.Amanda I.We needed to have some medical equipment delivered from our location to a major Detroit hospital, and contacted a bunch of couriers who quoted us ridiculous rates and said they couldn’t guarantee it would be delivered on time. This was for immediate use by the hospital by the way. Detroit Couriers picked up the phone on me and reassured me it would not only get delivered on time but also much cheaper than I was quoted everywhere else. They not only delivered on their promises, they also received a life time client and we now use them for all of our deliveries.Kim W.My company shipped a large pallet same day air through one of the airlines at to Detroit Metro Airport The freight weighed 1000 lbs and needed special delivery that required a box truck with a lift gate. Luckily, Detroit Couriers managed to get it taken care of and delivered to my customer in time. Would totally use them again and recommend everyone else to use them too.AVAILABLE 24/7/365Our ServicesDetroit Couriers has rush delivery and courier services to meet the delivery needs of the the people and businesses in Detroit, Michigan.

Accell Fresh. Not one or the other ""shoe horned"" into your restaurant's needs! We deliver better.Every Accell Fresh Certified driver has demonstrated knowledge and proficiency in food safety, driving safety, and unprecedented 5-Star customer service. This certification is the first of it's kind in the way it combines the exact recipe of safety and service in the food delivery industry.Accell.Co has been a leader in the restaurant or food delivery industry since 2008, long before the hype of the ""cookie-cutter"" RDS (Restaurant Delivery Service) companies. Current RDS companies have a one-size-fits-all model that is based on a web platform. Their depth of integrity for your deliveries and representing your brand at the user's end is like the Donald trying to sell humble pills.Accell Fresh has been an ingredient in the winning recipe of the food and catering delivery industry for 7 years with leaders such as: Agra Culture, Panera Bread, Cossettas, and Degidios. Accell Fresh 5 STAR Service1. Certified:  Accell Fresh Certified Drivers will have demonstrated and been tested on their proficiency and specialized knowledge in food safety, driving safety, and 5-star customer service.2. Uniformed:  Accell Fresh Certified Drivers arrive with clean-cut Accell Fresh uniforms, Accell vehicle identification, and personal identification badges.3. Service Time: 1 hour advanced notice. Restaurant designates pick-up time. 30 minute delivery from when it's ready to customer's table. 15 minute arrival window for customers. Courtesy call upon arrival. We deliver better by keeping hot food hot and cold food cold. *Refrigerated vehicle available upon request*4. Communication:  Accell Fresh Certified Drivers communicate via phone calls, texts, and software with contacts, dispatch, and always call contact upon arrival and ask where that customer specifically would like the product to be placed. The driver will never ask for a tip - if the customer or restaurant insists, the driver may receive a cash tip. Driver calls restaurant contact if weather or traffic cause issues for pick up or calls customer contact for delivery.5. Set-up: Accell Fresh Drivers will be trained on industry standards for catering set-up and layout (yes, we can set up pans, half pans, and chafers). Accell Fresh Certified drivers politely offer “would you like me to set this up and lay it out for you?”.  This helps the customer and displays Accell Fresh's “customer service disposition,” meaning, even if a set-up is not needed it communicates customer service!Medical courier Medical courier For Medical Professionals.Whether you are a hospital system, independent practice or medical business, you need a trust worthy, certified delivery partner to reliably and safely move the items.

This doesn’t have to be exact.Step Five - Take advantage of filters to order results by best match, oldest, and newest. This can help you cut through any close match entries that don’t match the men and women within your family tree. Tips for a Successful Missouri Courier Archive Search When dealing with common names, it can be difficult to find the right person amidst 330 years of U.S. history. Thankfully, there are multiple ways in which you can avoid adding people to your family tree who have no relation to you. The problem lies within the way records were taken before modern recordkeeping standards were introduced. A newspaper editor likely recorded information from oral sources; therefore, they may have misspelled a name or made a blatant factual error. Here are some more advanced tips for making sure you find the right ancestors via Missouri Courier historical data:Search for a relative by their initials. It was common practice for people to be recorded officially by the initials of their first and middle names.Female relatives were often recorded via their husband’s name. Rather than searching for a female ancestor’s name, try searching for their husband’s name instead.Use common misspellings. One wrong initial could mean you miss that forgotten family member. It can be time-consuming but incredibly exciting to come across family members you’d never heard of before. The Missouri Courier archive can add some color to the names. Discover your story. Be amazed at what you find.

The concrete trucks were making it so your driver could not get through. He called me, and was very polite. Was asking if there was another way through the subdivision to get to my house… Unfortunately, no. The concrete trucks eventually moved for the driver to get through. He was great! Brought my big basketball hoop to my garage for me. I know a lot of people would have been aggravated by the trucks in their way, but not this driver! He deserves a raise.AshleyDelivery went off without a hitch; pleasant professional personnelPamWe had ordered a part for a project with a tight deadline. Our order actually was shipped using Estes and apparently you are their delivery agent/3rd party shipper. Anyway, I spoke with Estes concerning the shipment as their online tracking showed the package was in St. Louis and we wanted to see when it was going to be delivered or could we possibly pick it up. After finding out from Estes that our package was NOT in St. Louis and the package was still somewhere on the truck, an employee with Estes gave me your company name and phone number to the St Louis location and gave me the employee Amanda to speak with. I spoke with Amanda and she was GREAT! I informed her of our situation and how we needed the shipment asap. When I called back around 3:45 yesterday to see if the truck had maybe shown up, it had and she got with her warehouse employee Eddie and they were able to find the shipment on the truck prior to it being able to be totally unloaded. I was able to send my employee down and Eddie was able to get it loaded for us. Both employees were a tremendous help on us getting our shipment picked up. I believe they went above and beyond to help us out. We were able to get the part installed in time thanks to both of them. Their help is greatly appreciated! I wanted to make sure someone knew how helpful these two employees were.Fry ElectricAt Grainger we value great service.

It is owned by Phillips Media Group.In addition to Hannibal, the Courier-Post covers several other communities in Marion, Pike, and Ralls Counties, including the cities of Bowling Green, Center, Louisiana, Monroe City, New London, Palmyra, Perry, Saverton, and Vandalia.Contents1 History1.1 Mark Twain2 References3 External linksHistory[edit]The newspaper claims to be the oldest daily newspaper in Missouri, having printed daily since 1853 and tracing its lineage back to several weekly newspapers in and around Hannibal: the Commercial Advertiser (1837), later called the Pacific Monitor (1840), Hannibal Journal (1841) and Hannibal Journal and Western Union (1850); the Hannibal Gazette (1846); the Hannibal Messenger (1851); and a Palmyra weekly, the Missouri Courier, founded in 1832 and consolidated with the Gazette in 1848.[2]The Journal converted to a daily March 16, 1853, the Messenger in 1858. The Messenger combined with the Courier in 1863, adopting the name North Missouri Courier. The daily Courier in 1891 merged with the Daily Post, marking the debut of the name Hannibal Courier-Post. The Morning Journal was acquired in 1918.[2]Individual owners had published the Courier-Post and its predecessors since the 1850s, including Thomas B. Morse, who had founded the Daily Post in 1886 and remained publisher of the merged newspaper until 1907. Morse sold the paper that year to Lee Enterprises, which invested heavily in its new acquisition, with a new printing press, Associated Press wire, and a new building.[2]Lee sold the paper to Stauffer Communications in 1969. Morris Communications acquired Stauffer in 1995.[3] GateHouse Media, purchased the Courier-Post in 2007.[2][4] Quincy Media, owners of the Quincy Herald-Whig, announced their purchase of the Courier-Post in 2019.[5]Mark Twain[edit]As the hometown daily newspapers of Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens), the predecessors of the Hannibal Courier-Post were an important part of the future literary star's youth.It was an advertisement in the Commercial Advertiser weekly, from February 27, 1839, that lured Twain's father John Marshall Clemens to Hannibal.[2]Twain himself worked on the Missouri Courier, as a ""printer's devil"" in 1849, as he recalled in a 1908 letter to the Courier's editors:[2]Surreptitiously and uninvited I helped to edit the paper when no one was watching; therefore I was a journalist. I have never been wholly disconnected from Journalism since; therefore, by my guess, I am dean of the trade in America.I hope the Courier will long survive me and remain always prosperous. Mark Twain.Twain's older brother, Orion Clemens, briefly owned the Hannibal Journal and Western Union, 1850-1853, employing Twain as a typesetter and contributor of articles and humorous sketches.In the Autobiography of Mark Twain, Volume 1, entry 29 March 1906,[6] Twain described his life as a printer's apprentice at the office of the ""Hannibal Courier"" (sic) and how a fellow apprentice was rebuked for abbreviating ""Jesus Christ"" to ""J.C."" when typesetting a sermon by Reverend Alexander Campbell. ""He (Rev. Campbell) said, 'So long as you live, don’t you ever diminish the Savior’s name again. Put it all in.' He repeated this admonition a couple of times to emphasize it, then he went away.""  As Twain described it:In that day the common swearers of the region had a way of their own of emphasizing the Savior’s name when they were using it profanely, and this fact intruded itself into Wales’s incorrigible mind. It offered him an opportunity for a momentary entertainment which seemed to him to be more precious and more valuable than even fishing and swimming could afford. So he imposed upon himself the long and weary and dreary task of overrunning all those three pages in order to improve upon his former work and incidentally and thoughtfully improve upon the great preacher’s admonition. He enlarged the offending J.C. into Jesus H. Christ. Wales knew that that would make prodigious trouble, and it did. But it was not in him to resist it. He had to succumb to the law of his make. I don’t remember what his punishment was, but he was not the person to care for that. He had already collected his dividend.Since the incident is described as having happened about 1847 (after Twain's father died), It shows just how old some idioms of swearing are.References[edit]^ ""Herald-Whig, Courier-Post sold to Phillips Media Group LLC"", Quincy Herald-Whig, Retrieved 26 August 2021.^ a b c d e f ""About Us"".

ShipCanada makes shipping to Nebraska easy as we provide transportation services for virtually every freight type directly into the state from any point within Canada.  Nebraska is a generally a 607 day transit from Ontario and a 4-6 day transit from British Columbia.   Nebraska is generally not considered a high-volume importer for Canadian goods.  This requires that shippers understand that transit times can very significantly to to weather and other factors. Our LTL (less than truckload) service options range from economy consolidated transit times to direct expedited service within no Cross-docking.  Our truckload and partial TL service can accommodate both dry and temperature controlled requirements with single driver an team option for time-sensitive freight.  Shipments originating in Canada that are destined for Nebraska must cross the international border between the U.S. & Canada and ShipCanada provides 24-hour monitoring of all shipments to ensure smooth an efficient customs clearance. For the best economy shipping rates on freight that is not time sensitive we offer Rail Intermodal service to all points west of Ontario.  For regular freight shipments with medium time sensitivity we offer economy over the road rates.  If your freight has to get to its destination faster our customers can choose Expedited LTL service which basically mirrors truckload transit times.  Regular and expedited services are also available for International shipping requirements.For freight that is absolutely time sensitive (meaning hours) we offer air freight service.  Give us a call.

Shipping can play an important role in that process, and many companies in New Jersey rely on brand-name delivery services to get their packages to and from destinations. However, those companies may not provide the quick, easy and affordable services found at 1-800 Courier. Businesses who trust their New Jersey courier needs to 1-800 Courier enjoy the benefit of regional and national service that's speedy, secure and practical.Regional and national coverageThose doing business in New Jersey often need to deliver packages to the major metropolises surrounding their state. With New York City to the north, Philadelphia to the west and localities such as Trenton and Newark within New Jersey itself, the state is at a crossroads of commercial activity. Major corporations have their headquarters in these cities, while smaller ventures help keep the economic wheel turning.Important packages, documents, equipment and supplies often need to head to and from these locations across some of the country's busiest highways, roads and interstates. That makes a reliable and secure New Jersey courier service all the more beneficial, since businesses need to know they've entrusted their goods with a New Jersey courier that has the resources and ability to deliver across state lines in an efficient and affordable manner.1-800 Courier can pull off those deliveries without difficulty. For more than 12 years, the experts at 1-800 Courier have cultivated and expanded a network of distributors and couriers with intimate knowledge of New Jersey's roads and byways. The company's resources allows clients to send packages around the state, transport goods to destinations in any of the region's major cities and arrange cross-country deliveries. 1-800 Courier's next flight out service makes national shipments to and from nearly any destination, something both small and large businesses can rely on.Safety and speedNew Jersey's roads are notoriously congested, but traffic jams aren't a valid excuse for businesses waiting on an important package. After all, those items aren't useful to clients if they're stranded in a delivery truck on the New Jersey Turnpike. 1-800 Courier has the New Jersey courier capabilities to ensure those deliveries are made quickly and safely. Flexible terms allow clients to arrange for customized delivery conveniently, whether by phone, internet or mobile app. Experienced same-day delivery solutions means clients'; packages will arrive faster and unscathed, giving them more time to work on the things that matter most to them.AffordabilityWhile other delivery companies can promise same-day shipping, few can guarantee it at the price of 1-800 Courier's New Jersey courier service. Finances are an important consideration for businesses both small and large, and not one can spare a dime on services or expenses that cost more than they are worth. Managers who receive a shipping quote at 1-800 Courier's website, by phone, or through its mobile app can see first-hand that the company's New Jersey courier service stacks up favorably compared to the competition.1-800 Courier's resources and flexibility allows it to ship items at a price that won't hurt clients'; bottom line, freeing them from the rigid restrictions and cost structures of other same-day delivery providers. The company's New Jersey courier offerings also provide clients easy scheduling, convenient tracking and helpful customer service, factors that have led many to rely on 1-800 Courier for their shipping needs.FIND OUT MORE »Major Cities Courier Services:AtlantaAustinBaltimoreBirminghamBostonCharlotteChicagoCincinnatiClevelandColumbusDallasDenverDetroitHartfordHoustonIndianapolisIrvineJacksonvilleLas VegasLos AngelesKansas CityMemphisMinneapolisMiamiMilwaukeeNashvilleNew JerseyNew YorkOaklandOrlandoPalo AltoPhiladelphiaPittsburghPhoenixPortlandRaleighRedwood CitySacramentoSan AntonioSan DiegoSan FranciscoSan JoseSan MateoSeattleSt. LouisTampaWashington DCAffiliatesCourier ServiceNational Courier ServiceRetail Courier ServicesPartners:Major Cities Courier Services:East CoastAtlantaBaltimoreBostonBrooklynCharlotteHartfordManhattanMiamiNew JerseyNew YorkOrlandoPhiladelphiaPittsburghQueensRaleighStaten IslandTampaThe BronxWashington DCMid WestColumbusChicagoCincinnatiClevelandDetroitIndianapolisJacksonvilleKansas CityMemphisMinneapolisMilwaukeeSt. LouisCentralAustinBirminghamDallasDenverHoustonNashvillePhoenixSan AntonioWest CoastAnaheimBeverly HillsBurlingameHollywoodIrvineLas VegasLong BeachLos AngelesOaklandOrange CountyPalo AltoPasadenaPortlandRedwood CityRiversideSacramentoSan DiegoSan FranciscoSan JoseSan MateoSanta MonicaSeattleSunnyvalePartners:AffiliatesCourier ServiceNational Courier ServiceRetail Courier ServicesLos Angeles FloristAtlanta FloristHOME|ABOUT US|TRACKING|NEWS|AFFILIATES|RELATED LINKS|SUPPORT|COVERAGE|MOBILE VIEW|TERMS & CONDITIONS|PRIVACY | API|CONTACT | Winner of the 2015 Pacesetter Award                Copyright 2001- 2022 1-800Courier - A Need It Now Delivers Company | FORM"

ShipCanada provides expedited and economy LTL services directly into New Mexico from any point within Canada.  New Mexico is generally not considered a significant trade partner with any particular Canadian provinces.  Our LTL (less than truckload) service options range from economy consolidated transit times to direct expedited service within Cross-docking.  Our truckload and partial TL service can accommodate both dry and temperature controlled requirements with single driver an team option for time-sensitive freight.  Shipments originating in Canada that are destined for New Mexico must cross the international border between the U.S. & Canada and ShipCanada provides 24-hour monitoring of all shipments to ensure smooth an efficient customs clearance.   ShipCanada can assist shippers with customs brokerage setup if required.  For the best economy shipping rates on freight that is not time sensitive we offer Rail Intermodal service to all points west of Ontario.  For regular freight shipments with medium time sensitivity we offer economy over the road rates.  If your freight has to get to its destination faster our customers can choose Expedited LTL service which basically mirrors truckload transit times.  Regular and expedited services are also available for international shipping requirements.For freight that is absolutely time sensitive (meaning hours) we offer air freight service.  Give us a call.  We can get the job done.  Call or email us today for a freight quote.

Marijuana				Cannabis rules New Mexico manufacturers, retailers, and couriers will have to follow					by: Curtis Segarra 			Posted: Dec 28, 2021 / 03:01 PM MST 			Updated: Dec 28, 2021 / 10:11 PM MST 		by: Curtis Segarra 			Posted: Dec 28, 2021 / 03:01 PM MST 			Updated: Dec 28, 2021 / 10:11 PM MST SHARENEW MEXICO (KRQE) – The Cannabis Control Division (CCD) has finalized state-wide rules for New Mexico’s cannabis manufacturers, retailers, and couriers. The rules are effective immediately.The rules come after several rounds of public comment from small business owners, CEOs of multi-outlet cannabis companies, and nearly everyone in-between. “Using best practices and input from stakeholders, the Cannabis Control Division has drawn on diverse experience and knowledge,” Kristen Thomson, the CCD director said in a press release.Who’s applying to be New Mexico’s first cannabis producers?Marijuana: Economics of New Mexico’s newest industryMarijuana: ‘Expungement removes barriers; we need that in New Mexico’Cannabis Decriminalization: What you need to know in 10 phrasesRecreational Marijuana: What you need to know in 10 numbersWho will regulate marijuana in New Mexico?ManufacturersThe rules establish what’s required to apply for licenses to manufacture cannabis products — including documents such as production premise diagrams and proof of water rights. It also establishes several types of cannabis manufacturers.Class I: packaging and re-packaging of already-made productsClass II: manufacturing of edibles or topical products from already-extracted products; can also conduct Class I activitiesClass III: manufacturing of extracts (extracting) using mechanical methods and nonvolatile solvents; can also conduct Class I and Class II activitiesClass IV: manufacturing of extracts (extracting) using volatile solvents or supercritical CO2; can also conduct Class I, Class II, and Class III activitiesThe rules set details on what can and cannot be included in a cannabis product. Vitamin E acetate is not allowed in products meant to be inhaled. That additive was linked to vaping illnesses in 2019.Manufacturers are also prohibited from adding nicotine or caffeine to cannabis products under the final rules. They can, however, create cannabis products in which sugar or caffeine already occur naturally, such as coffee, tea, or chocolate products.CouriersThe published rules set boundaries for cannabis couriers. The couriers, for example, are not allowed to drive vehicles with advertising or other markings on the side that would identify them as carrying cannabis, and couriers can only deliver shelf-stable cannabis products.Some of the rules focus on security. The maximum retail value of products a courier can carry at any given time is $10,000, and couriers are not allowed to hold on to packages for delivery for more than 24 hours. Delivery recipients will have their identity pre-verified electronically before a courier delivers cannabis. This is to ensure that the recipient is either over 21 years old or is an 18+ qualified medical cannabis patient or primary caregiver.RetailersThe rules also set requirements for cannabis retailers. They must provide employees with health and safety training within 30 days of hiring, for example. And employees who handle edible products must complete an American National Standards Institute food handler course.Retail sales are set to begin, by April 1, 2022. Once they do, only customers age 21 and over (and people 18 and over who possess a valid qualified patient, primary caregiver, or reciprocal participant registry identification card) will be allowed to access retail areas.The rules set strict quality-control standards for retail displays. Retailers can take cannabis out of the packaging to display for customers. But the displayed product cannot be sold or consumed — it must be destroyed. Retailers are also prohibited from providing free samples.The full rules can be found on the New Mexico Commission of Public Records website.Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

But sometimes the book is the story. That is certainly the case with a slim volume that has sat on my shelf for more than 30 years. Clad in red cloth, 6¾ inches wide and 8¾ inches tall, the work is called A Courier in New Mexico and dates back to when “courier” was used to describe someone we would today call a tour guide. In fact, author Mabel Parsons tells readers she worked as a guide for Fred Harvey Southwest Indian Detours in the late 1920s and after that operated her own tour company. But I am getting ahead of the story.If memory is to be trusted, I bought this book at the flea market on the state fairgrounds in Albuquerque in the late 1970s. At the time, the place abounded with literary treasures. For a few cents, for instance, I picked up an edition of The Best Short Stories of 1923, edited by Edward J. O’Brien. It’s a prized acquisition among collectors. Even though the book was dedicated to Ernest Hemingway, his name was so fresh to the literary world that it is misspelled in the table of contents as “Hemenway.”A Courier in New Mexico got my attention, as it gets the attention of everyone who has seen it, because it is a beautifully assembled and strikingly authentic work of love. One did not have to read a word to know that this was a bibliophilic gem. The text was mimeographed, with hand-colored initial capital letters at the start of each chapter, and each stitched section was divided by hand-colored maps printed on kraft paper with a compass rose made from the Zia symbol. Someone or some group of people had gone through an immense amount of trouble to put Parsons’ book together. This year, I set out to find out who Mabel Parsons was and how her little book had come into existence. In short, I would try to discover the story behind this book.A CRITICAL CLUEMy first stop was the New Mexico History Museum in Santa Fe, where I met with Tom Leech, the curator in charge of the Press at the Palace of the Governors. He had alerted Pamela Smith, who drove in from Abiquiú. Smith had established the museum’s press operation and for three decades had designed and printed limited-edition letterpress books; she was the author of Passions in Print: Private Press Artistry in New Mexico. If there were any two people in the state who might be able to answer my questions about A Courier in New Mexico, they were assembled in this room.Before our meeting, Leech had gone to the Fogelson Library at the Santa Fe University of Art and Design, which has one of nine copies of the book held in American libraries, according to the WorldCat, a massive network that allows one to search the catalog of almost every English language library. It is maintained by a cooperative called OCLC.(Sometimes one can hear older librarians say they are “checking OCLC” when they help a patron search for a book. It originally stood for the “Ohio College Library Center” when it was launched in 1967 and smoothly became the “Online Computer Library Center” with the advent of the internet. It would have been a harder nomenclatural change had it been, say, the Arizona College Library Center. Score one point for creating an organization in Ohio.)From his reading of A Courier in New Mexico at the Santa Fe University of Art & Design library, Leech judged Parsons to be an engaging writer. But he and Smith were deeply impressed when I placed my pristine and signed copy of the book on the counter in a setting that looked to the uninitiated like a graveyard of century-old printing presses. The dark metal behemoths, however, were anything but dead. “If you are not using a printing press, all you have is an 800-pound doorstop,” Leech quipped.With the book lying in front of them like a corpse, Leech and Smith began a gentle autopsy. “Look at that,” Smith said, as she and Leech opened the book and began to note aloud the style of its stitching, the manner by which the end sheets were glued, and the pencil-drawn Zia. “They show some awareness of book design,” Smith said of its creators.Neither had a clue about its author. The named publisher of the book, “Tesuque Printers,” was especially puzzling to Smith, who had never heard of it despite having completed an exhaustive history of printing in New Mexico. But they both became animated when I mentioned the “Mrs. Clark” that Parsons said in the foreword was her partner in the Tewa Tours company. Searching for information about Tewa Tours in old New Mexico newspapers, I had come across an article in a June 15, 1928, edition of the Las Vegas Optic. In it, the company was described as being run by two “young ladies” who were “experienced drivers” with “accurate knowledge of scenic points, historical points, and the best unsung places of the state.” The article named the two as Miss Mabel Parsons and Miss Anna Nolan Clarke.Leech went to a bookshelf, returning with several large illustrated children’s books. The Anna Nolan Clarke in the article, the two experts explained, was Ann Nolan Clark, one of New Mexico’s more famous authors, whose books Leech put in front of me. Clark published more than 30 children’s books, mostly about Native American culture. Parsons’ friend and business partner, it turned out, was a well-known author. As history’s keepers tend to be kinder to the possessions of the famous, I figured my best bet for learning about Parsons and her book was to follow this lead.GOLD AMID THE SHELVESMy next stop was the Zimmerman Library on the campus of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Named in honor of James F. Zimmerman, the university’s seventh president, the library is one of the state’s great cultural institutions. Frequented for 75 years by generations of students, it houses the state’s best collection of books, provides access to online research materials, and preserves collections of papers that once belonged to political, literary, and artistic New Mexicans.The place is a gorgeous and imaginative Pueblo-style edifice designed by famed architect John Gaw Meem. That alone makes the Zimmerman Library worth a visit even for those who have no interest in books. This is particularly true of its cathedral-like west wing. Among the library’s frequent visitors is Martha Bedard, the dean of the College of University Libraries and Learning Sciences. “It’s impossible for me to walk through this great hall every day, with its hand-carved vigas, lofty ceiling, and quiet echoes of those who spent long hours here, and not think about the emotional effect and aesthetic experience of the building itself, one of the finest examples of Spanish-Pueblo Revival in the Southwest,” she said.I began in the stacks and located a copy of Clark’s 1969 memoir, Journey to the People, published by Viking Press, and a copy of a Ph.D. dissertation on Clark’s early life written by Jeanne Carolyn Whitehouse. Armed with a cup of Starbucks coffee (yes, most major university libraries now have Starbucks), I sat down to read about Clark’s life. To my embarrassment, as one who likes to think he knows a bit about our state’s history, I had entirely missed learning about Clark until this moment.Born Ann Marie Nolan in 1896 in Las Vegas, New Mexico, Clark graduated from New Mexico Normal University, now New Mexico Highlands University. Shortly thereafter she ended up in Gallup, married to Thomas Patrick Clark, a member of the city’s semi-professional baseball team, one of several that had sprung up around the state, especially in mining camps. The marriage didn’t take, but it produced a boy named Thomas Patrick Jr., whom she always called Tommie. In need of work, Ann Nolan Clark got a job teaching at a Gallup school. The principal, who carried a walking stick and sported a stiff, round hat and wrist-length white gloves, was Mabel Parsons. Fifteen years Clark’s senior, Parsons took the single mother under her wings and infected her with enthusiasm for the ideas of John Dewey, under whom Parsons had studied at Columbia University’s Teachers College in her native New York. “She was a despot; still she made us believe in her way of teaching — at least I did,” Clark recalled years later in her memoir.In the late 1920s, Parsons received an invitation from the American Metals Company to open a school for the miners at the Terrero lead and zinc mine, located along the Pecos River about 14 miles up N.M. 63 from the village of Pecos. The mine had been a sleepy operation since its inception in 1882. But, according to Upper Pecos Watershed Restoration Action Strategy, a 2007 history of the watershed written by La Calandria Associates, the American Metals Company took over the mine in 1925 and greatly expanded it, leading to the need for a school. The offer from the mine company encouraged Parsons to bring along one or two teachers from Gallup. Thus Parsons and Clark moved high into the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Clark later told stories of Tommie, then 8 years old, exclaiming, “Look how high I am!” when he gleefully jumped from the door of their cottage, which bore a sign marking the 9,000-foot elevation of the camp. (The sign, however, more likely read 7,000 feet, the 2,000 feet added in the retelling.)Parsons and Clark expanded their educational partnership and growing friendship into a business venture by launching Tewa Tours. Parsons, who suggested the idea, had worked previously as a tour guide for the Fred Harvey Company, but Clark had no experience. For three summers, dressed in Western garb and hats, the two women took tourists around Northern New Mexico in a large black touring car nicknamed “Sitting Bull” because of its occasional refusal to start. When the car complied, their favorite route for their clients was to visit the pueblos of Tesuque, San Ildefonso, Santa Clara, San Juan (now Ohkay Owingeh), and Nambé before returning to Santa Fe via Santa Cruz and Chimayó.Concerned with finding secure work necessary to raise her child, Clark took teaching positions with the Bureau of Indian Affairs at a Zuni boarding school, the Santa Fe Indian School, and in 1933 in the BIA’s one-room school at Tesuque Pueblo, where she had worked as a substitute teacher a decade earlier. Her widowed mother, son Tommie, and friend Parsons all made the move with her. It was here that my book came to life.TEACHABLE MOMENTTo put the final pieces of the story together, I called on the author of the dissertation I had read at Zimmerman. In a cozy house not far from UNM, Whitehouse was eager to discuss Clark and Parsons, as most scholars are when asked about their work.Life in the school was hard on the women, she said. At first there was no water in the kitchen or bathroom. There was only one salary, a small one at that, which went to Clark as the teacher. Parsons worked as a volunteer in the school teaching woodworking and helping out where she could, while occasional but futile efforts were made to find a salary for her. It did not diminish the pair’s ardor for their work. A visitor found Clark and Parsons had “thrown themselves into their work with no reserve.”It was challenging work. For the pupils, English was a second language, so teaching reading was doubly hard. “At the time,” Clark recalled in her memoir, “we teachers thought our lot heartbreaking because of the almost impossible task that faced us each day.” In 1935, Clark was working on getting the four boys and one girl in her third grade to read books. Unlike today, the children were quite isolated from the world outside the pueblo. They considered books as alien objects of Anglo culture and wanted little to do with them. Clark hit upon the idea of having the children make a book, particularly one filled with the things the children knew and loved, as a means of interesting them in books. Clark had a small letterpress that the Pecos mine school had procured for her. But it wasn’t suited to running off the quantity of pages needed for a book. For that she required a mimeograph machine. The BIA budget was tight and, after buying toilet paper and cleaning supplies, little was left for paper, pencils, chalk, and other classroom supplies. Finding the money necessary for a printing machine during the Depression seemed impossible.But Parsons offered a solution. She reminded Clark of the book she had written about New Mexico sites that she used to brush up on the facts before taking tourists out on the Tewa Tours she and Clark used to run. “The manuscript was in a box somewhere; if she could find it, we could have it,” Clark wrote in Journey to the People. One night Parsons located her work. “Ideas came tumbling one over the other,” Clark said. They decided to publish and sell copies of the book and raise the needed funds. Using Clark’s monthly grocery allowance, they purchased a mimeograph machine. “We would sell Mabel’s book for a dollar a copy to pay me back for what I had spent,” she said. “Mother was our bookkeeper; the expense came to thirty dollars.”The third-grade children were enlisted. Stencils were cut for the 88 pages of Parsons’ text, and the newly acquired mimeograph machine began churning out pages. It was not long before the classroom was festooned with inked pages of text drying on clotheslines. Meanwhile the children colored the initial capital letters at the beginning of each chapter and the maps, printed across two pages of kraft paper. Second-graders were given the privileged role of applying beeswax to the sewing thread used to hold the pages together. When the pages were dry and the maps complete, Parsons and the third-graders bound them behind a title page printed on the letter press. “The book-hating third-graders with ceremony and pomp were henceforth the Tesuque Printers,” Clark said. In all, 30 copies were printed and sold for $1 each, paying back the loan from the grocery fund. “The Tesuque Printers now knew that books were only sentences made by people and put on pieces of paper and sewed together,” Clark wrote.But Clark was not done yet. Now with a mimeograph machine at the school’s disposal, the children turned to making a new book about life in Tesuque Pueblo. Clark encouraged her pupils to explore pueblo life, what she called “collaborative adventures.” When they returned to the classroom, Clark had them describe in detail what they had seen. In turn, she wrote it all down as poems, using, she said, “the rhythms and patterns of their speech.” The resulting 29 poems were run off on the mimeograph machine and bound in calico that one of the mothers supplied. It was called Third Grade Home Geography. “It was our book,” Clark said. “The children had seen it written. It was about things they knew, and they could read it.” In all, seven copies were made, and one of them ended up at the Washington, D.C., office of the BIA. From there it made its way to Viking Press. In 1941 the New York publisher released the book under the name In My Mother’s House, illustrated by Zia Pueblo artist Velino Herrera. It was an instant hit, was selected as a Caldecott Honor Book in 1942, and remains in print to this day.Clark and Parsons stayed at the Tesuque Day School for four and a half years. During the following two decades the BIA published 15 of Clark’s books, and she traveled on behalf of the Institute for Inter-American Affairs through Mexico, Guatemala, and South American countries. She was awarded the Newbery Medal in 1953 for Secret of the Andes, a book set in Peru. And for three decades she regularly contributed articles to New Mexico Magazine.Clark and her son made plans to build a house in the village of Tesuque. In the summers, he took odd jobs to learn construction. When World War II broke out, he became a pilot in the Army Air Forces. “So just as soon as he came from the war, two things were to happen,” Clark told Whitehouse in an interview. “I was to meet the plane with an Irish setter dog, and then the next day he was to start the house. But he didn’t come back.” Tommie had been killed in combat when his plane was shot down. Following Tommie’s death, Clark and Parsons built the small adobe house. Transporting cement bricks in a Chevrolet station wagon, the two, with the help of a pair of boys, erected the small house that still stands in Tesuque. It became the focus of Clark’s life and provided a reason to go on, Whitehouse said. “That home in Santa Fe,” noted a houseguest, “was the warmest, most cheering and relaxing home away from home any visitor could find.”The two women, who dressed alike in blue jeans and 10-gallon hats, raised cocker spaniels and called their home Red Dog Ranch. Clark worked long hours on her books, and Parsons typed her manuscripts. The partnership sustained Clark and permitted her to pursue her flourishing writing career. “If she hadn’t had Mabel as a companion,” Whitehouse said, “she wouldn’t have been able to do it.” Parsons died in Santa Fe in 1964. Clark died in Tucson, Arizona, in 1995, where she had moved to spend the final years of her life.HOMAGE AT LASTIn 1966, Spud Johnson, who wrote the “Santa Fe Gadfly” column in The New Mexican, told his readers he had found a copy of A Courier in New Mexico at a church sale. He asked if anyone knew anything about the Tesuque Printers. A few weeks later, Santa Fe photographer Laura Gilpin wrote Johnson to tell him that Parsons had died and Clark lived in Arizona. Johnson mailed a clipping of his column to Clark, who put it in a stack of items labeled “Answer Immediately.” There it remained until a few years later, when she ran across it while working on her memoir. “This clipping brought back memories of my first bout with reluctant readers,” Clark wrote in her memoir.For years, Clark wrote, she kept track of her Tesuque Printers. They had all gone on to the Santa Fe Indian School, which was then run by the federal government. Afterward the boys attended the Haskell Institute in Oklahoma, and the one girl, Veronica, moved to Riverside, California. Later, Clark added, she heard that one boy went to college in California and another became an accomplished Santa Fe artist.Now that the story of the book’s origins was complete, I decided to make the Tesuque Pueblo my final stop. Principal Corine Salazar welcomed me to Tesuque Pueblo Day School, also known as the Te Tsu Geh Oweenge Day School, tucked in at the end of a circular drive behind a stand of large cottonwoods on the southern side of the pueblo’s center. The main building looks much as it did in the 1930s, when Clark taught and Parsons worked as her assistant. Light brown stucco, with a two-story belltower-like entrance, the quintessential schoolhouse now houses the administrative offices, a library, and a room that the pueblo hopes will become a computer center. Marita Hinds, the principal’s administrative assistant, joined me while I explained to Salazar how I had come across A Courier in New Mexico and what I had learned about the book.The two knew about Clark’s tenure at the school. In fact, her books were displayed on the shelf of the main room. But neither had heard of the Parsons book and that it been published by the schoolchildren. When I mentioned the student named Veronica cited in Clark’s memoir, Hinds wondered if it might be her aunt Ronnie Vigil. A few weeks later, Claudia Lente at the pueblo’s senior citizen center invited me to stop in at breakfast time to meet Veronica “Ronnie” Vigil. She had been a pupil at the school in the 1930s and remembered Clark and Parsons fondly; Clark had become her godmother. But she wasn’t the Veronica who was Clark’s student; she had attended the school in a different year than when A Courier in New Mexico and Third Grade Home Geography were published.With that I closed my notebook. Perhaps some of the students from that class are still alive. Maybe when this story is published, some of them might see themselves in it. In the end, the little red book that had occupied my shelf all these years had its own story. It had been the work of third-graders almost 80 years ago that funded a mimeograph machine and launched the career of one of New Mexico’s most accomplished writers.I thought I was done, but I wasn’t. I had one more stop to make. Doing an internet search of gravesites, I found that Parsons had been buried in Memorial Gardens cemetery on Rodeo Road. The receptionist located her grave in the cemetery records and gave me a map. Under a blue sky of a crisp fall day I walked out to her unassuming grave marker. Imbedded in the grass, with three dry tan leaves resting on it, the marker simply reads, “Mabel I. Parsons, 1883-1964.” Thirty years after buying her book, I had a private moment to pay homage, one author to another.Parsons, like so many who have come to New Mexico, revered her adopted state. On the final pages of her book, Parsons writes about San Mateo Valley, where she said tourists almost never go. “But it is a lovely place, and I want to end my book with a bit of tribute to the old-time native New Mexicans who have been so kind to me these years I have lived in their New Mexico.” The place and its people, she said, taught her again of things she had forgotten. “New Mexico is not just a place, you know,” she writes. “It is a place and its people to be respected and loved because of the beauty of kinder ways of living here.” ◀FacebookTwitterWhatsAppSMSEmailPrintSaveFor three summers, dressed in Western garb and hats, Mabel Parsons and Ann Nolan Clark took tourists around Northern New Mexico in a large black touring car nicknamed ""Sitting Bull"" because of its occasional refusal to start.

I read ""Secret of the Andes"" and Ann Nolan Clark wrote back and we were pen pals for years.  She would write from all the places she visited doing research for her books.  In 7th grade my family and I met and visited with her in Arizona.  In later years I've gradually assembled a set of all of her books, including Courier.  She was such a generous educator, always willing to help a child see more of the world through her presence in it.  I'm glad to now read more detail about her early life that I never knew before.  Thank you.Report Add Replyvanann allenMar 30, 2014 11:04pmA great and accurate story.  I'm one of Ann Nolan Clark's great nieces -- and also have a copy of Courier, along with other early books written & printed by Ann and Mabel.  I remember well Red Dog ranch in the 50's, a crusty Mabel, the dogs, and long afternoons when my family would come in from California and the families would join w  serious rounds of bourbon as the sun set.  Prior to Tesuque Printer - in 1931-32 ""A.N. Clark, Zuni, New Mexico"" hand prints a truly lovely booklet - Hand Made Tales - all typography  and wood cuts -- no typewriter fonts likeCourier.thanks for bringing back fine memories!Report Add ReplyPaula LozarDec 4, 2013 12:46pmWhat a lovely story -- and a good description of how much fun it is to do research!Report Add ReplyTom Aageson AagesonDec 3, 2013 3:36pmA fascinating story very well told by James McGrath Morris.

The nature of our business was extremely time sensitive and the hours were difficult to staff for us in the past. RDS came in and did an excellent job learning the routes and procedures to ensure a smooth transition and professional service. The drivers and office team responded to inclement weather or any changes with urgency and always protected our business. If you're looking for a professional, established delivery service, I highly recommend the RDS team.Jeffrey Huang18:23 24 Sep 20I am writing a new review to emphasize on a previous review on my satisfaction with RDS.As a logistics coordinator for a business tasked with an emergency shipment of several hundreds of boxes on short notice within a modest budget, RDS has been an amazing, reliable, and utterly invaluable resource.  Every driver I have met with RDS - Ellis, Juan, Amin - have been courteous, fast, dependable, and punctual.  Each delivery I have made this past week have arrived on time or sooner, DESPITE setbacks.  The dispatchers, too - like Jenna and Joselyn - have been very dedicated, patient, and knowledgeable.An amazing company; I would recommend to anyone.Evin Epstein13:30 21 Sep 20RDS has been a trusted partner over the past 22 weeks for Food1st.

They were thorough, professional and reliable.  They were very timely and was able to deliver an important package to a family member in the hospital.  I am so appreciate of their service!Nat Milner22:51 05 Jul 20RDS saves the Day!I can not say enough good things about RDS.  In a world where disappointment is expected, RDS exceeded every expectation!I used them to move my apartment and family from the City to Long Island.  Being in the middle of a pandemic and having my business closed, money was very tight and moving is expensive.   I elected to move myself and hired RDS to provide a truck and a guy to help.   I crossed my fingers and prepared for a long horrible day.Rashaun arrived perfectly on time and perfectly professional in a 16 foot truck,  packing materials, dollys, hand trucks, and a mask and gloves as well to assure safety around my family.  Together we moved a piano, a king sized mattress, couches, 60 inch TV and a ton of other family stuff.  Who knew we could get so much into a two bedroom apartment.  The truck was filled to the brim.  Rashaun was amazing, he showed up ready to work.  He never blinked (even at the piano) and worked hard the entire time as we made trip after trip to the fourth floor.On the drive out we hit a ton of frustrating traffic (LIE accident).  The one hour ride took 2 and a half,  but Rashaun remained calm and never showed a moment of stress.  He was an exceptionally safe driver and was very careful knowing the contents of the truck was my whole life...On the other end we unloaded everything we put in.  Rashaun again was exceptional, exceeding every expectation even in the heat.  Even though we were behind schedule he never complained.   We got it off loaded faster than I would have expected and headed back.Spending the day with Rashaun was a true pleasure.  His easy demeanor and calm outlook made the day much easier.  He is clearly a people person and conversation was easy.  He shared that he has a long military career and continues to serve in the reserve to this day.  It all made sense.  I was expecting someone to lazily support my efforts all day, and instead I got a true partner who worked as hard or even harder than I did.  Wow.Thank you Rashaun and RDS!!!!   I honestly could not have done it without you.  The entire pandemic situation has thrown my world for a loop, as it has many others.  RDS was the one bright light in this whole mess.  RDS came through exactly and beyond what was promised and supported me and my family when we needed it the most.   Through this whole mess no other company has cut me a break or seemed to truly care about my situation at all.  Everyone is so absorbed in their own troubles.  RDS cares and it truly shows!!  From first call, to confirmations, to service delivery, RDS was on it every step of the way!I will be using RDS for all my future business and personal needs.   You have earned a loyal customer for life!  Thank you RDS for being there and for coming through when we really needed help the most.  I am happy to sing your praises from the highest rooftop!Bernadette McGoldrick17:13 02 Jul 20RDS is the best delivery service in Manhattan!

I work for a large non-profit organization that has been conducting food pantry pop ups serving over 1,500 in a one day pop up. Needless to say there is a lot involved in making this happen from packing bags to moving the packed bags to distribution, to even going upstate for produce pick ups from our farmers.  Larry Zogbys  been a total gem in helping us with moving of these bags and juice, picking up produce and when he couldn't accommodate  some of our requests, he was able to quickly connect us with a company that could!  His team is fabulous and gets the job done quickly and efficiently!  Larry even takes the time out of his busy schedule to check in on us and how we are doing and what can he do to help!! RDS has been a blessing to us!!Nan Shipley14:42 12 Jun 20Larry stepped in last minute to a very difficult delivery situation and handled it beautifully.

The physician and I both sang your praises.I thought your note was going to be another ‘sadly due to…..’ closure explanation- but instead: true to form, you are stepping upin a creative, exceptional manner.  Although I’ve become accustomed to your professional and sensitive philosophies-I am teary as I write.Your sense of humanity- as well as your own- serves as inspiration to us all.With gratitude and wishes for sustained health for everyone at RDS,Joanne StevensStevens Media Consulting, Ltd.Andy Alexander15:37 03 Feb 20RDS knocked it out of the park with our delivery.  Professional and friendly staff really went out of their way.  I would recommend them to anyone.Donna Fischer15:25 22 Jan 20RDS picked up our boxes and delivered them safely and timely to their destination! Driver was very courteous and professional.

Working directly under CEO Larry Zogby I have always been able to connect where I am today back to my experience working at RDS. Now working as an educator totally switching up my profession I still am able to reflect on all the skills learned working in business development. Today as I was driving I happen to pass by an RDS sprinter van. As I passed the van I immediately reflect on a question that I was asked nearly a hour before seeing the RDS van. That question was “name a person who has contributed to your growth as a professional” and my response was Larry Zogby. He is someone who gave young me the confidence to own any professional setting I am in and not only meet but exceed the expectations. He gave me an opportunity that NO ONE! Else was willing to give me fresh out of college. He believed in me and I am grateful for the way he has impacted me professionally and personally THAN YOU!Janet17:22 21 Nov 19I needed to overnight a package from NYC to Long Island. Someone recommended RDS delivery and they provided the same day delivery. I asked for 12:30 pick up and 4:30 delivery. I wasn’t  quite ready with the package when the pick up person arrived but they waited patiently for about 10 minutes and delivered the package on time. The communication with the company and updates were great. I would recommend them to anyone needing a secure fast delivery!Melissa Rodriguez03:38 07 Nov 19JH EA20:01 09 Oct 19RDS has been a part of our business for years. Always fast and reliable, we have never had an issue with their services. Their entire team goes above and beyond to ensure packages are delivered, from customer service calling when there are unexpected delays (flash storms, holiday rushes, etc.), to the messengers connecting with both the sender and receiver to guarantee it has arrived in the correct hands. We highly recommend RDS.esweg22:44 08 Oct 19Reliable, professional and awesome customer service!  Shout out to Justin and Larry for coming through in the clutch.

Excellent customer service.A. Cutt16:46 31 Jul 18We used RDS for a move for a client in our nonprofit. Larry and his team could not have been more helpful and supportive in arranging this move. They not only responded quickly, but worked with us to get an emergency safety transfer done on the day requested with little notice. The movers themselves arrived on time and were extremely professional. Due to limited income, our client did not have things boxed up but were in bags, and the movers were polite and understanding of the situation. Since this move I have interacted with RDS several times, and one of our young people has even gained employment with them. I will certainly be using RDS again in the future, and could not recommend them more. Thank you Larry and the RDS team for making this hard move as easy as possible for us and our client.Brian Jaffe20:14 25 Jul 181,000% dedication to customer service and addressing the needs of their client. Special situations and requests are never an issue. They will work on creating a program that WORKS for your business needs. No need to hesitate, you found the right messenger service.S and M L19:32 25 Jul 18RDS Delivery is the most reliable messenger service I have ever dealt with.  In my line of business, not only timeliness is important, but an excellent chain of custody is required.  RDS satisfies both of these criteria above and beyond expectations.  Larry, David, Jenna, Destiny, and all of the people I deal with there are simply amazing.  You feel that for them it is not just business.  They hold the highest regard and importance for handling my deliveries as if it were their own.  They always work with me to deliver all sizes of packages to many different areas, at all different times.  I am truly amazed at how they always get it done right.Ryan Avery21:40 20 Jul 18Thinking of using RDS? Then it should be a YES!!!! RDS truly delivers!  I had a film crew and 85 volunteers lined up to film a segment of my reality show “Breaking History” and RDS perfectly handled many of the logistics.  RDS secured, delivered and picked up a table and chairs as well as all the other supplies for the event. It actually had its driver do a dry run of the location the day before (AMAZING)! RDS... highly recommended!!!Matthew Weiss14:31 19 Jul 18We needed a reliable messenger service to pick up and deliver 11,000 bandanas for a world record attempt in Central Park.  Based on our past, positive experiences with RDS, we knew who to call.  The job was difficult because delivery was in the middle of the park, away from any open roadways and because we needed to clean up our bandanas when we finished but, due to the fact that they were still tied together, this would have been time-consuming to break down.  RDS solved both problems and executed flawlessly on them.  They made a stressful and important project much, much easier.   We, therefore, highly recommend RDS without any reservation.Beianca Person23:10 16 Jul 18RDS delivery service literally a step above the rest! Trusting a delivery company with everything that matter most to you is very hard but with RDS it was easy and seamless. Moving from Brooklyn to Long Island with a little one on the way I needed someone I could trust. RDS had a dedicated team of dispatchers the were there to answer any and all of my concerns and/or adhere to my needs. The delivery men were professional and worked effortlessly to provide me with exceptional service. I know that RDS is amazing cause ever since the day they assisted me my husband raves about seeing the delivery vans and foot messengers while he is working in the city. Then I am currently in Grad school and my institution uses RDS for all of their delivery needs. If you have a need for delivery services anywhere in NY I highly recommend RDS Delivery!Enzo Bonura00:55 10 Jul 18Working with RDS was a pleasure. They gave me the peace of mind I needed to ensure my packages arrived on time. Thank you to the staff of RDS for working so diligently and for excellent customer service!!!Nathalie Garcia00:49 10 Jul 18What a great service!!! Love that you can track your online orders and it’s very accurate.Mary Obering21:05 06 Jul 18See all reviewsWrite a review "
